the abolition of work does not mean the abolition of the need for effort, the desire for activity, the pleasure of creation, the need to cooperate with others and be of some use to the community. instead the abolition of work simply means the progressive but never total suppression of the need to purchase the right to live by alienating out time and our lives. [… ] the abolition of work means the freeing or liberation of time so that individuals can exercise control over their bodies, their use of themselves, their goals and productions. [… ] The demand to work less does not mean or imply the right to rest more, but the right to live more.”
