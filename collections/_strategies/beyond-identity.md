  <p>Long-term visions of the future:<p/> <p> #6 Systems of justice that center
  on harm prevention and the promotion of care, rehabilitation, and education,
  that does not seek to respond to violence with violence.  <br />  <br />  We
  want a society that centers collective freedom and justice over profit and
  punishment. Carceral systems do not provide adequate housing, proper mental
  health treatment or the means to a good life. Nor do punitive systems keep us
  safe. We strive for a world where we focus our energy on harm prevention,
  through ensuring that all humans have access to what they need. We aspire to
  forms of transformative justice for responding to social harms, such that the
  circumstances that led to harm are transformed at the core.</p>

  Directional demands, utopian impulses, non- reformist reforms - the small
  action that we can take today that anchors us toward our aspirations. <br />
  <br /> Defund the police, decarcerate and also invest in alternative modes of 
  harm prevention and response.

  <p/> <p>#1 Marinaleda in Southern Spain — have eliminated the need for police
  by ensuring that every resident of the 3000 person town has access to housing,
  income and the means to thrive.<p/>

  <p>#2 Cherán, in Michoacán, Mexico — removed the state police nearly a decade
  ago. Despite Michoacan being “one of Mexico’s bloodiest states — where severed
  heads have been rolled across dance floors and grenades have been lobbed into
  crowded plazas. In July, there were over 180 murders in the state — the
  highest number for nearly a decade. And in the communities around Cheran — not
  even 10km away — stories of kidnap, extortion and murder are commonplace.” —
  in the last year there have been no murders, kidnaps or disappearances.<p/>

    Defend the rights of those incarcerated, especially during COVID19 - “By
    keeping more people in the jails, you are increasing the overall number of
    people who contract the virus,” and the demand for hospital beds,
    ventilators and other lifesaving resources, said David E. Patton, head of
    the federal public defender’s office in New York City, which represents
    nearly half of the 2,500 inmates in the city’s two federal jails. “They are
    playing roulette with people’s lives.” <p/>

    Defend the rights of those incareated to vote. "One of the most perverse
    elements of the American criminal justice system -  all across the country,
    almost everyone incarcerated on a felony conviction loses their right to
    vote during the entire time they spend in prison, and often for long periods
    even after their release — a phenomenon advocates refer to as “civic
    death.”</p>
