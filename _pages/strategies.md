We aim to bring together individuals, communities and organisations that represent diverse populations into a global movement that not only refuses to go back to the normal that yesterday brought us, but that also strives for an affirmative tomorrow.

The status quo has long been an emergency for many, and we seek not to react, but to build on what has been germinating. We must make our own demands, of ourselves, instead of looking to imaginary powerless institutions to solve these issues.

We cannot be bystanders, passively consenting to what has been an emergency for so many, for so long.  The volunteer coordination that rose up to support the British NHS, the global mutual aid networks that are coordinating help to where it needs to go, reminds us of our collective power.

## Tactics
- We seek new possibilities
- We hope to enable some of these changes to take place via a range of strategies. 
- We hope to form affinities and solidarities with many existing orgs and communities, to amplify the voices of a mass movement - to weave together a new ‘we’. We listen to the work of others, our intention is to amplify the voices of this movement, not be leaders of a movement. 
- We intend to provide clear guidelines for anyone who wishes to participate in this or related movements, ways to take action. 
- We point to real world examples and prototypes that are testing the very strategies that we need to build a world that represents us all. 
- We intend to create space to imagine and envision what is possible. Whilst we delude ourselves by thinking we enact change through votes at elections, in reality the process begins much much earlier than that. In what we collectively dare ourselves to imagine. Humans have to believe these things are possible, before politicians will take up the mantle. 
- We aim to engage both exit and voice as strategies for societal transformation. 
- We work to link small steps that are actionable today (non reformist reforms), to long term idealist goals.
