		Here, we aim to not only imagine what a united humanity is capable of but also strategies for how we can get there. We envision a future where humans collaborate for our collective well being, rather than compete, nation against nation, based on arbitrary water lines and borders.
		</p>

		<p>
		We imagine a world where no human needs to toil for their right to mere survival, but instead we collectively ensure that all humans have their needs met.  
		</p>

		<p>
		This sounds a bit far out? 
		</p>

		<p>
		Let your imagination dream big. Humans are not impressive as solitary creatures, but in collaboration, we have colonised all corners of this earth, have made our way to other planets, have found cures for impossible diseases. 

		</p>

		<p>
		Just imagine what we could achieve, if we stopped pitting our countries against each other, <a href="/actions.html"> <strong>if we were all in it together</strong></a>.

		<h1>New Solidarities</h1>  

		<p> Our goal here is not to lead the movement but to lift the movement, to forge links where there were none. To create windows where there were once walls. </p><p>We acknowledge that the work, practices and writings that we are relying on here have been built and put together by those for whom the status quo has always been a crisis. These ideas and ideals are often birthed out of necessity from marginalised communities.</p><p>As always we stand on the shoulders of giants, and we rest on the shoulders of their struggle, their trauma and their love. We remain in debt and gratitude to the work of this generation of communities.</p>

		<p>We cannot represent every human, but we hope to be in solidarity with every human, to help forge a mass movement that can drive us toward a better collective future for all... </p>
