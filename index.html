<div class="section">
	<p>
	Here, we aim to not only imagine what a united humanity is capable of, but also develop strategies for how we can get there. We envision a future where humans collaborate for our collective well being, rather than compete, nation against nation, based on arbitrary water lines and borders. 
	</p>

	<p>
	We imagine a world where no human needs to toil for their right to mere survival, but instead we collectively ensure that all humans have their needs met. 
	</p>

	<p>
	This sounds a bit far out? 
	</p>

	<p>
	Let your imagination dream big. Humans are not impressive as solitary creatures, but in collaboration, we have colonised all corners of this earth, have made our way to other planets, have found cures for impossible diseases. 
	</p>

	<p>
	Just imagine what we could achieve, if we stopped pitting our countries against each other,  if we were all in it together.

	<h2>Our Collective Goals</h2>
	<ol>
	<li>An economy that prioritizes life, ecological stability and inclusivity, rather than an economy that relies on endless capital accumulation and extraction.</li>

	<li>An economy that can be put on hold if we are facing a global emergency without great damage, that allows us to stop and pivot, that is adaptive to the emerging needs of our species and planet(s). </li>

	<li>A united global set of interests and collaborations that serve a higher goal than imaginary national interests </li>

	<li>Our collective health, treated as a public good -  free healthcare for all, with a focus on preventative medicine and united global health care. </li>

	<li>Legal and corporate structures that prioritize diverse and long-term life and inclusivity / banning of structures that incentivize profit over externalities.</li> 

	<li>A means of production that is not dependent on human labour to provide for this ecosystem.</li> 

	<li>Decolonised, degendered, post human futures that values all life irrespective of form.</li> 

	<li>Transformative justice, food justice, financial justice over carceral processes.</li> 

	<li>Open borders - freedom to accept and welcome into our communities people from anywhere and everywhere, irrespective of their geography of birth. </li> 


	<li>Freedom to create affirmative economic enclosures - alternative self-contained opt-in micro-economies with their own logics - without being taxed or regulated by the State </li> 
	</ol>

<div class="section">
	<h2>Shared Critiques</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Systemic inequities resulting in the poor distribution of resources, services, access, mobility, status, pleasure and care. </li> 
		<li>Zero-sum games—systems and patterns of production and distribution that require some to lose in order for others to win. </li>
		<li>Concentration and enclosure for private benefit. </li>
		<li>Economic growth as a unilateral metric of success. </li>
		<li>Squandering the future, whether through short-sighted and risky economic investments, polluting/depleting production processes, or other unsustainable practices that shift the burden of the present onto future generations. </li>
		<li>Hierarchies of social stature rooted in—and reinforcing—regimes of status, identity, position, attractiveness, etc. </li>
		<li>Standardized regimes of desirability, aspirational goals, mono-cultural attitudes and aesthetics, and normative prescriptions designed to maintain hierarchies. </li>
		<li>Forms of justice that center punitive measures, taken after harmful events have transpired, rather than prevention through appropriate care.</li>
	</ol>
